# Virtual-Garage-Vehicle-Cooldown
Adds cooldown timers to pulling Vehicles out after storage and storing vehicles after pulling them out to prevent storing too quick after being fired upon etc.
Example 1: Player retrieves vehicle and get's attacked by players. They can't store the vehicle for x mins. So the vehicle is now vulnerable.
Example 2: Player starts getting attacked while in vehicle at base. They store it, saving it from attack, attacker flys or drives off to re-position, they cannot retrieve said vehicle now to use on the moving attacker for x mins, thus preventing abuse of the VG to save vehicles and attack the attacker while their back is turned.
Great example is Helicopter vs AA vehicles. Helicopter always loses when VG is being abused by people that never leave their bases. (DM)
